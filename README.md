# Overview

The purpose of this project was to two things, both of which reveal business insights about the PyBer company and will help make decisions about how to improve it. The first goal of the project was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The second was to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type – Rural, Suburban and Urban. both of these deliverables can be seen below.

# Results

The results reveal that Pyber’s ridesharing services are more popular in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural ones. Urban cities have more total rides, more drivers and bring in more money in fares. However, the average fares per ride and per driver are the lowest. Rural areas have the least number of total rides, the least total drivers and generate the smallest amount of fares. However, the average fare per trip and the average fare per driver are the highest in these rural areas. Suburban areas are in the middle in all aspects of the data we were looking at. All of this is clearly reflected in the DataFrame above. 




# Summary

From these learnings, there are three recommendations that I would make to the CEO. The first is to test lower fares in Rural areas. This might encourage more people in these areas to use the app. The second is to test higher fares in Urban areas. If the demand remains the same (or even if it decreases slightly) the Urban areas have the potential to bring in even more revenue than they already do. The third is to test adjusting fares depending on current events. If there's a big event in an area, or it is raining, or there's some other cause for higher demand, it may be beneficial to test higher prices to see if more revenue can be generated.
